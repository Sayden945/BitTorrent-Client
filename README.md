# BitTorrent CLI

This project was created to further my knowledge in regards to both JavaScript and also different technologies. As regular file sharing over internet access is asymmetric due to download speeds being greater than upload speeds, 
this often creates inefficiencies limiting bandwidth as well as the upload having to be constantly online to access. By utilizing the BitTorrent protocole we can share files utilizing a peer-peer method, this allows us to download "blocks" of data between peers, leveraging
the ability for each block to be then re-uploaded between peers in the swarm, as we are downloading blocks rather than the entire file this allows us to have decentralised file sharing system where no-peer requires the full file to seed the uploads.

# Usage
This program can be utilized by entering the file address into the programs CLI as an argument.
